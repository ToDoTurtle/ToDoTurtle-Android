## About the project:
This is our reminder app! We are Pablo, Ferran and Oriol, writing from the ToDoTurtle headquarters (Maraquitas). 
We're a team of young and passionate developers who share a common love for programming. 


As we were exploring the possibilities of NFC technology, we realized that there was a gap in the market for a reminder app that integrated NFC capabilities
seamlessly. We wanted to create an app that not only allowed users to set reminders, notes, 
and deadlines easily but also provided an innovative and efficient way to interact with them using NFC technology. 
Our team is excited to bring you an app that we believe will simplify your life and keep you on top of your tasks and schedule.
